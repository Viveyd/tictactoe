This project recreates the game tic-tac-toe as a web application.  The game is played on a 3x3 square. Player will select how many players in the game (1-2), and decide if an AI will be joining. Player can decide if he wants to take either X or O as his mark. First player to place 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins and ends the game. Otherwise, when all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
